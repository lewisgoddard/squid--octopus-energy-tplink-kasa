# TP-Link Tapo / SMART transport — plan

How Squid would talk to TP-Link's newer **SMART** protocol (Tapo-branded devices, and
newer Kasa firmware) over the cloud — the prerequisite that unblocks **TRV setpoints**
(KE100/KH100) and brings **Tapo plugs/bulbs/strips** into the same rate automation.

Status: **Research + the whole Worker-side transport are built & tested offline (46 tests, tsc
clean).** `signV2` (cross-checked vs openssl), `V2_PROFILES`, the builders, `tapoToken`,
`smartCall`, and `kasaSetTargetTemp`→`smartCall` (guarded on `env.RELAY`) all exist in
`squid/index.js`. **What's left is live integration, gated on the Containers entitlement:** deploy
`tapo-relay`, add the `[[services]]` binding, create the `tapo_tokens` table, then validate the
login/refresh wire shapes + MFA refresh-token bootstrap against the live cloud. The Tier-3 rule
model (`invert` + setpoint, inverted `cheaper_than_gas`, the evaluate setpoint pass, `hubOf`) is
built and now writes through `smartCall`. See [DEVICE_SUPPORT.md](DEVICE_SUPPORT.md) Tier 3.

## Why this, and what it unblocks

- **KE100 TRV setpoints** — KE100 speaks SMART, not Kasa IOT. Setpoint logic is done; only
  the write is missing.
- **Tapo plugs/bulbs/strips** (P100/P110/P300, L530, …) — same SMART cloud; today invisible
  to Squid. P110 even exposes energy data.
- **Newer Kasa "v2" firmware** — on the *same* V2 cloud (`n-wap.tplinkcloud.com`, also a
  private CA), same protocol, just a different **cloud profile** (host + app keys). The relay
  and transport must be designed profile-driven so Tapo and Kasa-v2 share one code path.

## Phase 0 findings (the open questions, answered)

Grounded in piekstra/tplink-cloud-api (a **pure-cloud** lib supporting both Kasa and Tapo),
TA2k/ioBroker.tapo, python-kasa, and Cloudflare docs. No hardware — treat as
reference-verified, not live-verified.

**Q1 — Separate login? YES (same credentials).** Tapo uses the **V2 cloud**:
`POST https://n-wap.i.tplinkcloud.com/api/v2/account/login` with `appType/appName =
TP-Link_Tapo_Android`, `cloudUserName`/`cloudPassword`/`terminalUUID` → `result.token`
(+ refresh token). Same TP-Link account as Kasa, but a **separate token + host** (and a
distinct app AccessKey/SecretKey). Devices via `GET /api/v2/common/getDeviceListByPage`.

**Q2 — Cloud relay path? `passthrough`, plaintext, but signed.**
`POST {host}/api/v2/common/passthrough?token=…` with body `{deviceId, requestData}` where
`requestData` is the **plaintext** inner command, e.g. `{"method":"set_device_info",
"params":{"target_temp":21}}`, JSON-stringified. **No per-device encryption** — the cloud
owns the device's secure session. Every V2 request is **HMAC-SHA1 signed**:
- `Content-MD5: base64(md5(body))`
- `X-Authorization: Timestamp=9999999999, Nonce=<uuid>, AccessKey=<app key>, Signature=<hex hmacSHA1(secret, "{md5}\n9999999999\n{nonce}\n{path}")>`
- App keys are hardcoded from the Tapo APK (not user secrets).

**Q3 — KLAP vs securePassthrough? Neither, for cloud.** KLAP / old-RSA-securePassthrough /
TPAP-SPAKE2+ are **local** device handshakes (only when talking to the device on the LAN).
Over the cloud the session is the cloud's job, so the KE100/KH100 is just `control_child` +
`set_device_info` inside the signed V2 passthrough. **This removes the entire crypto
subsystem from the plan.**

**Q4 — Workers crypto? Not a constraint.** The only crypto the cloud path needs is **MD5 +
HMAC-SHA1** for signing — both in `node:crypto` (full API in Workers with `nodejs_compat`;
WebCrypto also does HMAC-SHA1). The earlier RSA-PKCS1v1.5 worry is moot (no RSA needed; and
`node:crypto` has `publicEncrypt` anyway).

**Q5 (new) — TLS / private CA? The blocker.** piekstra ships `tplink-ca-chain.pem` and
builds a custom SSL context because *"the V2 API servers (`n-*.tplinkcloud.com`) use
TP-Link's private CA, which is not in the system trust store"* (root `tp-link-CA` →
`TP-LINK CA P1` → `*.tplinkcloud.com`). Workers `fetch()` validates against the **public**
root store with **no API to add a CA or skip verification** (the mTLS binding presents a
*client* cert; Workers VPC only added *Cloudflare's own* Origin CA). So
`fetch('https://n-wap.i.tplinkcloud.com/…')` from a Worker should fail the TLS handshake.
(Note: Squid's current Kasa path uses the **V1** host `wap.tplinkcloud.com`, which has a
public cert — that's why it works today.)

## Does this break the pure-Worker design?

Probably, for the cloud path — unless one of these works:

| Option | Idea | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **`fetch` as-is** | Hope the V2 host chains to a public root | Very unlikely (private CA is explicit) |
| **`node:tls` + `connect()`** | Raw TLS socket with the TP-Link CA as `ca`, speak HTTP/1.1 manually | Skip-verify **ruled out** (see spike); custom-`ca` **unconfirmed** (deploy-only) |
| **External relay** | A tiny non-Worker service / Container / Tunnel origin that holds the CA and forwards | Works, but abandons "no extra infra" |
| **Local agent** | Control Tapo locally via a home box (HA, etc.) Squid calls | Biggest change; see the Matter discussion |

## Phase 1 — TLS spike result

Live probes settled the `fetch` question; a throwaway Worker spike (since removed — it was
deployed to the edge, tested, and torn down) tested the `node:tls` escape hatch in `workerd`:

- **`fetch` → blocked (certain).** `openssl`/`curl` reject `n-wap.i.tplinkcloud.com` against
  the public store (`issuer = TP-Link Cloud Server CA`, `verify code 20`); `curl --cacert
  <chain>` passes (HTTP 405) — i.e. the CA *works if trusted*. Workers `fetch` has no way to
  add it.
- **`connect()` → blocked (certain).** `SocketOptions` is only `secureTransport`/`allowHalfOpen`
  — no CA / no `rejectUnauthorized`.
- **`node:tls` skip-verify → ruled out.** `tls.connect({ rejectUnauthorized: false })` throws
  **"The options.rejectUnauthorized option is not implemented"** in workerd.
- **`node:tls` custom `ca` → ruled out (deployed test).** The spike was **deployed to the real
  edge** and hit there. `fetch` returned **526 (Invalid SSL Certificate)** — Cloudflare rejects
  the private-CA origin. Both `node:tls` attempts (default *and* custom `ca`) failed with
  **"proxy request failed … It looks like you might be trying to connect to a HTTP-based
  service — consider using fetch instead"** — i.e. **workerd refuses raw-socket/`node:tls`
  connections to HTTP(S) web services**, full stop. So you can't hand-roll HTTPS to bypass the
  trust store; the custom-`ca` idea is moot because you can't open the socket at all.

**Bottom line: every pure-Worker path is closed, confirmed on production `workerd`.** A
Cloudflare Worker **cannot reach the Tapo V2 cloud** — `fetch` won't trust the private CA, and
`node:tls`/`connect()` won't open a socket to a web service to work around it. **A relay (or
local control) is required.**

## Revised architecture (if the TLS spike passes)

Much smaller than the original crypto-heavy plan.

**Relay topology — chosen: option #2 (separate, service-bound, no public URL).** The relay
stays its own Worker (`tapo-relay`) with `workers_dev = false` and **no `RELAY_SECRET`** —
Squid reaches it via a **service binding** (`env.RELAY`), which is the access control. (Option
#1, embedding the container in kraken, was rejected: it would couple a Docker build + the
Containers entitlement into every kraken deploy.) The kraken-side `[[services]]` binding is the
one piece deferred to integration — adding it before `tapo-relay` is deployed could break
kraken's live deploys.

- `relayFetch(relay, targetUrl, init, opts)` — ✅ **built + tested** (`squid/index.js`,
  `test/relay.test.js`). Boot-tolerant relay client: `env.RELAY.fetch` with the target in
  `X-Forward-To`, `timeout` (default 30s, > the container's ~20s port-ready window) + **one
  retry**; returns upstream HTTP errors (doesn't retry them), throws cleanly on exhaustion.
- `signV2(bodyJson, path, app)` — ✅ **built + cross-checked vs openssl** (`test/sign.test.js`).
  Content-MD5 + X-Authorization (md5 + HMAC-SHA1, `node:crypto` via `nodejs_compat` + a minimal
  `node-crypto.d.ts` shim). Hardcoded timestamp `9999999999`; per-request UUID nonce.
- `V2_PROFILES` + builders — ✅ **built + tested** (`test/v2.test.js`). `V2_PROFILES.{tapo,kasa_v2}`
  (host/appType/app-keys), `buildV2Login` / `buildV2Refresh` / `buildV2Passthrough` (the last wraps
  a hub child in `control_child`). `buildV2Refresh`'s body shape is flagged — awaits live validation.
- `tapoToken(env, profile, forceNew)` — ✅ **built + tested** (`test/transport.test.js`). Per-
  `(user, profile)` cache in `tapo_tokens`; refresh-token-first (MFA-safe), password-login fallback.
- `smartCall(env, profile, deviceId, method, params, childId?)` — ✅ **built + tested**. Builds +
  signs the `POST /api/v2/common/passthrough` and sends via `relayFetch(env.RELAY, …)`, unwraps
  `responseData`, re-auths once on failure. Cron + manual control tolerate the cold-start latency.
- `kasaSetTargetTemp` — ✅ **now calls** `smartCall("set_device_info", {target_temp})`, guarded on
  `env.RELAY` (clear error until the binding exists). `RELAY` typed in `worker-env.d.ts`.
- **Transport selection:** tag each snapshot device `proto: "iot" | "smart"`; route reads/
  writes accordingly. Rule engine, `resolveTarget`/`hubOf`, snapshot, endpoints stay
  protocol-agnostic.

## Phases

0. **✅ Research** — done.
1. **✅ TLS spike** — done & **deployed** to the real edge. Result: pure-Worker is impossible
   (526 on `fetch`; `node:tls` won't socket to a web service). → a **relay** is required.
2. **⛳ Relay** (now the gating step) — minimal passthrough Container (see Relay design). Best
   validated first by a **container spike**: forward one request to `n-wap.i.tplinkcloud.com`
   from a Container called by a Worker, and confirm it gets past the cert (expect 405/JSON,
   not 526). Proves the architecture before building the transport.
3. **✅ Worker-side transport built (offline)** — `signV2` (cross-checked vs openssl), profiles,
   builders, `tapoToken`, `smartCall`, `kasaSetTargetTemp`→`smartCall`. 46 tests / tsc clean.
   The remaining work in phases 3–5 is **live validation through the deployed relay**, so it's
   all gated on Phase 2 (the relay deploy, which needs the Containers entitlement):
   - **Login + device list** — confirm the live login round-trip + add signed `getDeviceListByPage`
     (and validate `buildV2Refresh`'s body shape, currently flagged).
   - **One Tapo plug end-to-end** — read + on/off via signed `passthrough`; MFA refresh-token bootstrap.
   - **Hub children** — confirm `control_child` for KE100 against real hardware refs; ungate is done
     (guarded on `env.RELAY`).
4. **Integrate** — `proto` routing; Tapo plugs/bulbs join the existing on/off + colour rules.

## Risks & constraints

- **TLS private CA (Q5)** — the make-or-break; resolve in Phase 1 before any other build.
- **No hardware** — validate against references + the live TLS/login spike only.
- **Request signing brittleness** — exact sig string / hardcoded app keys can change with
  app versions; copy from a current reference and expect to bump `appVer`.
- **Account lockout / MFA** — V2 surfaces MFA + lockout error codes; reuse cached tokens,
  back off, surface clearly.
- **Regional hosts** — TP-Link runs **3 regions** (DNS-confirmed; all other region codes
  NXDOMAIN): `use1` (AWS us-east-1), `euw1` (eu-west-1), `aps1` (ap-southeast-1, Singapore),
  on patterns `n-{region}-wap-gw.tplinkcloud.com` and `{region}-app-server.iot.i.tplinknbu.com`.
  The base hosts `n-wap[.i].tplinkcloud.com` are **geo-routed**, so don't hardcode a region —
  use the regional URL returned by `getAccountStatusAndUrl`/login. (`aps1`'s IPs are Singapore
  despite the code; trust the resolved region, not the label.)

## Recommendation

The deployed spike settled it: **a pure-Worker Tapo transport is not possible** (the Worker
can't trust the private CA via `fetch`, and can't open a raw socket to work around it). The
protocol itself is small and understood — so the work is now entirely about **reachability**:

1. **Pick a relay** (the realistic options, smallest first):
   - **Cloudflare Container / Durable-Object sidecar** — runs Node with a normal TLS stack
     that can trust the bundled TP-Link CA; the Worker calls it over a binding. Keeps it all
     on Cloudflare.
   - **Tiny always-on box** (VPS / home server / the user's existing infra) running the Tapo
     calls, exposed to the Worker via a Tunnel or signed HTTP.
   - **Local control** (Matter / Home Assistant) — covered in the Matter discussion.
2. **Then** the transport is small: `tapoToken` (V2 login) + HMAC-SHA1 signing + V2
   `passthrough` (plaintext `requestData`) run *on the relay*; the Worker calls the relay and
   un-gates `kasaSetTargetTemp`. No device-level crypto.

Until a relay exists, Tier-3 TRV writes stay gated (the rule model is already done and inert).
This is a **product/infra decision** — confirm the relay shape before building.

## Relay design — minimal passthrough Container (chosen direction)

The relay is a **stateless, credential-free, CA-trusting HTTPS forwarder** — nothing more.
All TP-Link/per-user logic stays in the Worker; the Container only does the one thing the
Worker can't: terminate TLS to a private-CA origin and forward.

> **Build status (`relay/`): built & locally validated; CF deploy blocked on account
> entitlement.** The forwarder (`forwarder.mjs`) + CA bundle (`tplink-roots.pem`, both
> private roots — Tapo "Cloud Root CA" via piekstra, Kasa/NBU "tp-link-CA") were validated
> locally against **all three V2 hosts**: `n-wap.i.tplinkcloud.com` (Tapo), `n-wap.tplinkcloud.com`
> (Kasa-v2), `euw1-app-server.iot.i.tplinknbu.com` (NBU) all return **real responses** (the
> Tapo passthrough even returns a genuine `{"error_code":-10000,…405…}` JSON) — TLS trust +
> forward + host-allowlist + the 403/400 error cases all pass. The container image **builds**
> (amd64) and the **Worker uploads**, but `wrangler deploy` fails at `GET /containers/me →
> Unauthorized`: **Containers isn't enabled on the account** (needs a Workers **Paid** plan +
> Containers onboarding). Once enabled, `cd relay && wrangler deploy` should just work — then
> the deployed end-to-end test (Worker→Container→Tapo, expect the 405 JSON not a TLS error).
> Set `RELAY_SECRET` via `wrangler secret put` (it's a secret, not a `[vars]` entry — the
> Worker fails closed/401 until it's set, and secrets survive automated deploys).

**Responsibility split (multi-user safe):**

| Concern | Where | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Per-user auth: MFA bootstrap, **refresh-token** store + refresh (Auth & 2FA below) | **Worker + D1** (`tapo_tokens` by user_id) | no passwords stored; secrets never in the relay |
| HMAC-SHA1 request signing (Content-MD5 + X-Authorization) | **Worker** (`node:crypto`) | signature covers body/path/nonce only — unaffected by forwarding |
| Building the call (method/params, `control_child`, query) | **Worker** | all SMART semantics stay in one place |
| Retry / token refresh / lockout / rate-limit (per user) | **Worker** | |
| **Trust the TP-Link CA + forward the request** | **Container** | the *only* job the Worker can't do |

**Interface (generic, no TP-Link knowledge in the Container):**
- Worker → Container via a **Container binding** (DO-fronted; *not* a public URL), sending the
  fully-formed request: target URL + method + headers (incl. the signature) + body.
- Container validates the host against an **allowlist (a set, not one glob)** and forwards with
  the TP-Link CAs trusted (`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`, or explicit `ca`), streaming back
  `{status, headers, body}`. ~40 lines; reusable for any private-CA origin.

**Hosts & CAs (both private — confirmed):**
- Allowlist: `*.tplinkcloud.com` (login/list/`passthrough`) **+ `*.tplinknbu.com` only if** the
  NBU app-server (`{region}-app-server.iot.i.tplinknbu.com`, device `/v1/things/.../details`)
  turns out to be needed — aim to do everything via `passthrough` and avoid it (open question).
- **CA bundle must trust BOTH private roots:** *TP-Link Cloud Root CA* (→ Tapo
  `n-wap.i.tplinkcloud.com`) **and** *TP-LINK CA P1* (→ Kasa-v2 `n-wap.tplinkcloud.com` **and**
  `*.tplinknbu.com`). The earlier TLS spike embedded only the Tapo root; the real container
  needs both.

**Security:** binding-only (no public ingress) + host allowlist (no SSRF/open-proxy) +
optional shared-secret header. CAs baked into the image.

**Consequences to accept (call these out):**
1. **Credentials transit the relay.** To reach the private-CA host, the Container must
   terminate TLS, so it *sees* the plaintext per-user traffic — including the password on the
   login call. It **stores** nothing, but it's in the credential path. Fine for a
   single-operator self-host; for true multi-tenant SaaS the operator's relay sees users'
   TP-Link traffic (inherent to any cloud relay — can't be avoided while the Worker can't do
   the TLS itself). Pure TCP passthrough doesn't help (the Worker still couldn't do the TLS).
2. **Cold starts / cost.** Containers scale to zero and wake on request (~seconds). Fine for
   the 30-min evaluate cron; adds a little latency to interactive control.
3. The Container is shared across users and holds **no state** — all fan-out/keying is the
   Worker's, by `user_id`, exactly as today.

## Cloud profiles — one transport for Tapo *and* Kasa v2

The V2 protocol is identical across brands; only a few constants differ. Model a **profile**:

| Profile | Host | appType / appName | App keys |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tapo | `n-wap.i.tplinkcloud.com` | `TP-Link_Tapo_Android` | Tapo AccessKey/SecretKey |
| Kasa v2 | `n-wap.tplinkcloud.com` | `Kasa_Android_Mix` | Kasa AccessKey/SecretKey |

Same login path, same HMAC-SHA1 signing, same `/api/v2/common/passthrough`. The transport
takes a profile; the relay is profile-agnostic (host allowlist covers both V2 hosts). A device's
profile comes from which login enumerated it. (Legacy Kasa stays on the **V1** public-cert path
Squid uses today — no relay, no change.)

**Open question — do we touch the NBU host?** Everything for control should be reachable via
`/api/v2/common/passthrough` on `*.tplinkcloud.com` (`set_device_info`, `get_device_info`,
`get_child_device_list`). The separate NBU app-server (`*.tplinknbu.com`, `/v1/things/.../details`,
`Authorization: ut|<token>`) is an app convenience and **also private-CA** ("TP-LINK CA P1"). Aim
to avoid it; if a required read proves NBU-only, add `*.tplinknbu.com` to the relay allowlist (the
CA bundle already needs that root for Kasa-v2).

## Auth & 2FA (multi-user) — keep 2FA on

The V2 cloud is MFA-aware (`/api/v2/account/checkMFACodeAndLogin`, `/api/v2/account/refreshToken`,
errors `MFA_REQUIRED -20677`, `TOKEN_EXPIRED -20651`, `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRED -20655`). So instead
of requiring 2FA to be **off**, do a **refresh-token bootstrap**:

1. **One-time bootstrap** (per user, interactive): username/password → if `MFA_REQUIRED`, user
   submits their code via `checkMFACodeAndLogin` → returns access token **+ refresh token**.
2. **Store the refresh token** per user in D1 (`tapo_tokens`: `user_id, profile, refresh_token,
   access_token, expires_at`). **Never store the password.**
3. **Refresh thereafter** (`refreshToken`) for short-lived access tokens — no password, no MFA.
4. **On `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRED`** → prompt a re-bootstrap (surface clearly; don't silently fail).

This makes 2FA a one-time setup rather than a blocker, and is a better security posture than the
current single-user `TPLINK_USERNAME`/`TPLINK_PASSWORD` secrets (which only work with 2FA off).
A new bootstrap endpoint (`POST /api/tapo/bootstrap` { username, password, mfa_code? }) is the
main new surface. **To verify:** exact MFA request/response shape, refresh-token lifetime, and
whether a stable `terminalUUID` reduces MFA prompts.
